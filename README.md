# Brain-Region-Connections-Text-Lab
Text Analysis and Visualization Project for Data Visualization Class

For this visualization, I took 3,150 paper abstracts related to brain region connectivity from [pubmed.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and analyzed the connectivity of the regions based off the literature. Note that the medula term was not in any abstracts, but I kept it in the visualization because it is an important part of the brain. The brain regions are color-coded the general larger regions that they are in.

The text analysis was performed in the [Jupyter Notebook](Text.ipynb), and the resulting .csv files were incorporated and visualized in the [HTML file](index.html). 

See [here](https://sarmxzh.github.io/Brain-Region-Connections-Text-Lab/) for the resulting interactive visualization.
