# Brain-Region-Connections-Text-Lab
Text Analysis and Visualization Project for Data Visualization Class

Took 3,150 paper abstracts related to brain region connectivity from [pubmed.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and analyzed the connectivity of the regions based off the literature. Note that the medula term was not in any abstracts, but I kept it in the visualization because it is an important part of the brain. The brain regions are color-coded the general larger regions that they are in.
